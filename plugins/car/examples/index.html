require(['tquery.pproc', 'tquery.skymap', 'tquery.keyboard', 'tquery.car'], function(){
	// ## Let's start coding

	// We start to create our world as usual. We enable the
	// [boilerplate for three.js](http://learningthreejs.com/blog/2011/12/20/boilerplate-for-three-js/).
	// It is a fast way start, avoids repetitive tasks, following DRY principles and includes all those good practices which are so easy to forget.
	// Then we just have to ```.start()``` the rendering loop on this world.
	var world	= tQuery.createWorld().boilerplate().pageTitle('#info').start();

	world.addEffectComposer().vignette().finish();

	// Now we setup the renderer.
	// In this scene, we want to cast shadows as if it cames from the sun.
	// This is a nice way to improve the realism in our 3D scene
	// We already talked about it in ["Casting Shadow"](http://learningthreejs.com/blog/2012/01/20/casting-shadows/) 
	// The renderer needs to be notified so we set ```.shadowMapEnabled``` and ```.shadowMapSoft``` to true.
	world.tRenderer().shadowMapEnabled	= true;
	world.tRenderer().shadowMapSoft		= true;

	// ## The Sky
	
	// Now we add a sky to the 3D scene.
	// It will fill the space and make the scene more realistiv.
	// We use a skymap for that. It is is WebGL trick which take a cube, make it so large that it seems infinite.
	// On it, we map a 360degeree texture shaped as a cube, and use a special shader to display it. All is in this
	// shader, it makes the cube appears as if we were in a gigantic sphere. Exactly like we would feel with a sky above
	// our head.
	// We already saw skymaps in ["let's do a sky"](http://learningthreejs.com/blog/2011/08/15/lets-do-a-sky/) post.
	// We just added a new plugins ```tquery.skymap.js```.
	// It avoid repeative code when you do skymap or environement map.
	tQuery.createSkymap('skybox').addTo(world);

	// ## The Lights

	// Here we setup the lights. We put one ambient and 2 directional lights.

	tQuery.createAmbientLight().addTo(world).color(0xFFFFFF);
	tQuery.createDirectionalLight().addTo(world).position(1,1,-1).color(0xffffff).intensity(2);

	// It is rather simple so lets focus on the last one, the one casting shadow.
	// We want it to appear as coming from the sun. 
	// So we looks at the skymap and approximatly localized the sun at ```(-10, 20, 30)```.
	// Then we tune shadow parameters to fit our tastes.
	// You can find more details in ["Casting Shadow"](http://learningthreejs.com/blog/2012/01/20/casting-shadows/) post.
	// Those parameters can be tricky to tune. It helps if you make the shaddow
	// camera visible. You can do so with ```.shadowCameraVisible(true)```.
	tQuery.createDirectionalLight().addTo(world).position(-10, 20, 30).color(0xffffff).intensity(4)
		.castShadow(true).shadowDarkness(0.8)
		.shadowMap(512*2,512*2)
		.shadowCamera(10, -10, 20, -20, 0.1, 50);

	// ## The Ground
	
	// Now we add the ground. A car needs a ground to stand on :)
	// For that, we got a little helper ```tquery.grassground.js```.
	// This is just building a ```THREE.Plane``` and mapping a grass
	// texture into it. does the job for a simple and fast ground.
	// We have seen something similar with ```tquery.checkerboard.js``` in
	// ["tQuery Plugin for Doom Characters"](http://learningthreejs.com/blog/2012/05/04/tquery-md2character-a-plugin-for-doom-characters/)
	// post.
	var ground	= tQuery.createGrassGround({
		textureUrl	: '../../grassground/images/grasslight-big.jpg',
		textureRepeatX	: 30,
		textureRepeatY	: 30,		
	}).addTo(world).receiveShadow(true).scaleBy(100);
	ground.get(0).material.map.anisotropy = 16

	// ## The Car
	// First we instanciate a ```tQuery.Car``` object with ```tQuery.createCar()```.
	// It will load the models, then material will be setup.
	// ```tQuery.Car``` handles the displacement of the car too.
	// You can make the car turn, go forward and backward, using ```car.controls()```.
	// you can even switch on/off the lights with ```.flareVisible()```
	var car	= tQuery.createCar();
	// Then we had the car model in our world scene. Important if you want to see it :)
	world.add(car.model())
	
	// Now we got the car on the scene, this is all good.
	// But we need the camera to follow this car. We create a camera controls specific
	// to mimic the usual camera in car game. The camera is placed a bit behind the car and look forward.
	// The faster you go, the further you look. This is always nice to see what is coming at you :)
	tQuery.createCarCameraControls(car, world);

	// ## Car Controls

	// Now we hook the controls to the car. This determines how the player will controls the
	// car. It can be controlled by the keyboard, so users press arrows on keyboard
	// and the car moves.
	// It can be controlled by the [device orientation](http://dev.w3.org/geo/api/spec-source-orientation.html).
	// We already talked device orientation in game in
	// [this post](http://learningthreejs.com/blog/2011/09/20/lets-make-a-3D-game-device-orientation/).
	var hasTouchEvent	= "ontouchstart" in window;
	if( hasTouchEvent )	car.hookDeviceOrientation();
	else			car.hookKeyboard();
	
	// Now maybe you wonder "why this devices orientation" ?
	// I ported tQuery to IOS. So since tQuery r49.1, it is possible to run
	// tquery on your iphones or ipads.
	// It is possible to render with [canvas 2D](http://www.w3.org/TR/2dcontext/) in the regular browser.
	// Even possible to render WebGL using
	// [WebGL Browser](https://github.com/benvanik/WebGLBrowser) by [Ben Vanik](https://twitter.com/#!/benvanik).

	// ## The Road
	
	// In a scene, it is cool to create a goal, something for the user to do.
	// A road seems like a perfect goal for a car :)
	// First we create the material we gonna use. This is a [lambert](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lambertian_reflectance)
	// with a [reflection](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reflection_mapping). You put a cube texture in the
	// ```envMap``` parameter and you got your reflection :) Here again, we use tquery.skymap.js to create the cube texture.
	var material	= new THREE.MeshLambertMaterial({
		ambient	: 0x444444, 
		color	: 0x666666,
		envMap	: tQuery.createCubeTexture('skybox')
	});

	// Now we add the arches. In fact, they are torus which are half in the ground, so the visible part looks like an arche.
	// We put 5 of them along the Z axis. they are all aligned to give an kindof road.
	// ```.castShadow(true)``` make the 3D object as casting shadow. Always a nice trick to enhance realism.
	for(var i = 0; i < 5; i++){
		tQuery.createTorus(1.25-0.25, 0.25, 8, 6*4, material).addTo(world)
			.castShadow(true).translateZ( 2 + i * 5 );		
	}
	
	// And we are **DONE**! We got a nice looking car, driving on grass with a sun set. It is 
	// controlled by keyboard and the camera controls is suitable for a game. Not bad
	// for 40 lines of javascripts.
	
	// TODO here put the iframe of the demo
